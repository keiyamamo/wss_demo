This repository aims to illustrate the significant disparity in wall shear stress between the P2 solution and the P1 solution interpolated from the original P2 solution.

On the left side of the image, you can observe the "pseudo" wall shear stress computed based on the P2 solution, while the right figure is computed using the P1 solution. Despite the almost identical velocity used to calculate wall shear stress in both cases, there is a notable difference in the computed wall shear stress.
